## ðŸ¤– AI Development Workflow

**Stop losing hours to AI context limits.** Decision Tapestry maintains persistent project context across all your AI tool conversations.

### The Problem
- Hit Cursor's context limit and lose 3 hours of architecture discussion
- Explain the same project structure to Claude repeatedly  
- v0 forgets your design decisions from previous sessions
- Multiple AI tools give conflicting suggestions without context

### The Solution
```bash
# Track AI activity in real-time
decision-tapestry activity start

# Export context to any AI tool
decision-tapestry plan --context-export
```

**Perfect for teams using:** Cursor â€¢ Claude â€¢ v0 â€¢ Windsurf â€¢ GitHub Copilot â€¢ Lovable

### ðŸ†• New in v1.7.0: Enhanced Real-time Experience
- **Live Dashboard Updates**: All changes appear instantly without browser refresh
- **Agent Activity Visualization**: See who's working on what in real-time
- **Improved Reliability**: Robust file watching with automatic fallbacks
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Activity badges and animations on decision nodes  

### âš¡ Quick Tasks: From Idea to Execution in One Command
```bash
# Create decision and start agent immediately
decision-tapestry quick-task "Fix login button styling"

# With specific files
decision-tapestry qt "Refactor user auth" -f src/auth/login.js src/auth/validate.js

# With multiple tasks
decision-tapestry qt "Add profile page" -t "Create component" "Add route" "Add tests"

# High priority without agent
decision-tapestry qt "Fix production bug" -p high --no-agent
```

Quick tasks are perfect for:
- Bug fixes that need immediate attention
- Small refactoring jobs
- Feature additions with clear scope
- Experimentation and prototyping

Visual indicators (âš¡) in the dashboard show which decisions were created as quick tasks.
