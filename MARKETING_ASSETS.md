### Tutorial Outline

#### Introduction (2 minutes)
- Hook: "I just spent 3 hours with Cursor and lost all context"
- Demo the problem: Show context limit error
- Preview: "Here's how to build production apps with AI"

#### Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
# Show actual commands
npx create-react-app weather-app --template typescript
cd weather-app
decision-tapestry init
decision-tapestry start
decision-tapestry activity start
```

#### Decision 1: App Architecture (3-4 minutes)
**Scenario**: Starting fresh project, need architectural foundation
**AI Collaboration**:
1. Start conversation with Claude about React weather app
2. Claude suggests: React + TypeScript + API integration
3. Capture decision in Decision Tapestry with full reasoning
4. Show AI activity badge appearing on decision node
5. Export context for next AI conversation

**Demo Highlights**:
- Real-time decision capture
- AI activity tracking
- Context preservation

#### Decision 2: State Management (3-4 minutes)
**Scenario**: Need to manage weather data, loading states, errors
**AI Collaboration**:
1. Import previous context to Cursor conversation
2. Cursor suggests: "React Query for server state, Zustand for client state"
3. Human monitors in real-time via Decision Tapestry dashboard
4. Course correction: "What about offline support?"
5. Update decision with new considerations

**Demo Highlights**:
- Context continuity between AI tools
- Real-time monitoring
- Human oversight and guidance

#### Decision 3: UI Design (3-4 minutes)
**Scenario**: Create responsive, accessible weather interface
**AI Collaboration**:
1. Start conversation with v0 for component design
2. v0 creates weather card components with Tailwind
3. Human reviews designs in Decision Tapestry
4. Feedback loop: "Make it more mobile-friendly"
5. Track design iterations and reasoning

**Demo Highlights**:
- Multi-AI coordination
- Design decision tracking
- Iteration management

#### Decision 4: API Integration (3-4 minutes)
**Scenario**: Integrate OpenWeatherMap API with error handling
**AI Collaboration**:
1. Multiple AI suggestions for API architecture
2. Claude: "Use React Query with custom hooks"
3. Cursor: "Add retry logic and caching"
4. Human decision: Combine approaches
5. Resolve AI conflicts with documented rationale

**Demo Highlights**:
- Conflict resolution between AI suggestions
- Production-ready considerations
- Complete decision audit trail

#### Results & Advanced Features (2-3 minutes)
**Showcase Final Workflow**:
- Complete project context preserved
- AI activity timeline showing all interactions
- Decision dependency visualization
- Context export for new AI conversations
- Team onboarding with instant context

**Before vs After Comparison**:
```
‚ùå Without Decision Tapestry:
- Lost context every 2-3 hours
- Re-explained project 6+ times
- Conflicting AI advice
- No decision history
- 2+ days for simple app

‚úÖ With Decision Tapestry:
- Persistent context across all AI tools
- Real-time AI monitoring
- Conflict resolution system
- Complete audit trail
- 4-6 hours for production app
```
