      commit_count: 7
      git_derived: true
    status: Completed
    rationale:
      - GitHub webhooks would provide real-time updates for PRs and issues
      - Would complement existing GitHub API integration from decisions 65-68
      - Reduce API rate limit usage by receiving push events
    tradeoffs:
      - Requires public endpoint for webhook delivery
      - Need to handle webhook security and validation

    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Authors need GitHub avatars and usernames for better recognition and trust
      - GitHub user data provides richer context than plain text names
      - OneOf schema approach allows progressive enhancement while maintaining backward compatibility
      - Enhanced author objects support display_name, avatar_url, profile_url, and email
      - Caching strategy prevents API rate limiting issues
    tradeoffs:
      - GitHub API rate limiting requires careful caching strategy
      - Adds external dependency on GitHub service availability
      - Complex authentication setup for GitHub access
      - Schema migration complexity for existing author strings
      - Need fallback handling for non-GitHub authors

    title: Implement Git history analysis for commit-based decision dating
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date:
      decision_date: "2025-07-15T22:16:00Z"
      first_commit_date: "2025-07-15T15:52:53-04:00"

      commit_count: 6
      git_derived: true
    status: Completed
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Decisions should use actual Git commit dates for accurate historical timeline
      - Enhanced date schema supports both manual dates and Git-derived metadata
      - OneOf date approach allows decision_date, first_commit_date, last_commit_date
      - File status tracking shows created, modified, deleted, and missing components
      - Commit metadata provides rich context with sha, message, url, and author
    tradeoffs:
      - Performance impact of Git history analysis on large repositories
      - Complexity of matching decisions to specific commits
      - Handling of renamed or moved files over time
      - Large repositories may have slow Git operations
      - Enhanced date objects increase data complexity

    rationale:
      - GitHub avatars make authors instantly recognizable
      - Author cards provide quick access to GitHub profiles
      - Visual author filtering is more intuitive than text lists
      - Components must handle both string authors and GitHub user objects
      - Enhanced UI should display GitHub metadata like PRs, issues, and commits
    tradeoffs:
      - Complex UI components increase maintenance overhead
      - Visual complexity might overwhelm some users
      - Requires graceful fallback for non-GitHub authors
      - Additional CSS and component complexity
      - Need to handle mixed author formats in same view

    title: Enhance time filtering with commit-based date ranges
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date:

      commit_count: 11
      git_derived: true
    status: Completed
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Filtering by actual commit dates provides more accurate results
      - Enhanced date schema allows filtering by decision_date, first_commit_date, or last_commit_date
      - File activity indicators show recent changes using github_metadata.file_status
      - Commit timeline visualization reveals development patterns from github_metadata.commits
      - Integration with Git history makes filtering more meaningful
    tradeoffs:
      - Increased complexity in date filtering logic
      - Performance considerations with large Git histories
      - UI complexity with multiple date filtering options
      - Potential confusion between decision date and commit date
      - Need to handle both string dates and enhanced date objects

    notes: |
      This decision depends on the completion of decisions 65-68 and represents the 
      final integration phase of the GitHub MVP. Success criteria include:
      - Authors display GitHub avatars and usernames (oneOf: string | GitHub user object)
      - Decisions filter by actual commit dates (oneOf: string | enhanced date object)
      - File creation dates auto-populate from Git history
      - GitHub metadata (PRs, issues, commits, file_status) displays correctly
      - Graceful fallback when GitHub unavailable
      - Backward compatibility maintained with existing string authors/dates
      - Progressive enhancement working (string → GitHub object migration)

    status: Accepted
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Dashboard needed intuitive search and filtering capabilities for decision discovery
      - Manual categorization was impractical - inferred categories provide automatic classification
      - Mobile-first design ensures usability across all device types
      - Interactive visualizations make data exploration engaging and informative
      - Dual-range sliders provide flexible time period selection
    tradeoffs:
      - Inferred categorization may not be 100% accurate for all decision types
      - Complex UI components increase maintenance overhead
      - Performance considerations with large datasets
      - Visual complexity might overwhelm some users

    status: Done
    rationale:
      - Captured during development workflow using decision-tapestry capture command
      - Redis provides fast, persistent session storage for web applications
      - Enables horizontal scaling by externalizing session state
      - Built-in expiration handling for session cleanup
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds Redis dependency and infrastructure complexity
      - Requires Redis availability for application to function
      - Additional network latency compared to in-memory sessions
      - Need Redis backup/replication strategy for production

    rationale:
      - To effectively collaborate on complex system design, we need a mechanism to record not just *what* was changed, but *why* it was changed.
      - This system serves as a shared memory, preventing knowledge loss and ensuring design choices are durable and understood over time.
    tradeoffs:
      - Initial setup requires a small time investment.
      - The process adds a minor documentation step to our workflow.

    date: "2025-06-23T11:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Collaboration Process
    rationale:
      - To accelerate debugging and prevent wasted cycles, we need a standard for reporting bugs in generated artifacts.
      - Clear, actionable bug reports are essential for our collaborative efficiency.
    tradeoffs:
      - This adds a minor step to bug reporting, but it will save significant time in the long run by eliminating guesswork.

    title: Evolve Decision Tapestry for Prompt Integration
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-23T09:00:00.000Z"
    status: Superseded
    superseded_by: 4
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To make our system more dynamic and less manual, we need to integrate it directly with our workflow—the prompts we exchange.
      - This will transform it from a passive documentation tool into an active collaboration partner.
    tradeoffs:
      - This will introduce significant complexity, requiring us to venture into natural language processing and more complex data handling than our current YAML file.

    title: Defer Prompt Integration to Maintain Simplicity
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-23T10:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The complexity introduced by prompt integration (even manual) outweighs the immediate benefits.
      - We are making a conscious decision to prioritize the simplicity and maintainability of the core system.
    tradeoffs:
      - We lose the ability to directly visualize the link between our conversations and our decisions for now.

    title: Redesign Charter Map for Non-Linear Process
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-24T13:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The current hierarchical layout of the charter map creates a misleading linear visual, which does not accurately represent our iterative, non-linear workflow.
      - A physics-based layout will provide a more honest and intuitive visualization of our process.
    tradeoffs:
      - The exact layout will be less deterministic, but this is an acceptable tradeoff for a more accurate representation.

    status: Superseded
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - A timeline view could provide a powerful chronological perspective on our decision-making process, complementing the structural view of the graph.
      - Provide a sense of decision-making velocity.
      - Serve as a chronological reference point.

    title: Replace Interactive Timeline with a Simple Chronological Log
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-25T15:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The interactive timeline proved to be overly complex for the core job of quickly referencing past decisions.
      - A simple, scannable HTML list provides better usability and maintains system simplicity.
    tradeoffs:
      - Removes the interactive/visual element, but this is an acceptable tradeoff for improved readability and focus.

    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-25T16:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - As decision-making velocity increases, a simple date is insufficient for accurate chronological ordering.
      - Full ISO 8601 timestamps provide the necessary granularity.
    tradeoffs:
      - Requires a one-time migration of existing data and slightly more verbose entries going forward.

    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To make our process more transparent and actionable by bridging the gap between high-level decisions and the granular work required to implement them.
      - Provides a clear 'definition of done' for each decision.
      - Helps gauge complexity at the start of the decision-making process.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a small amount of complexity to the data structure and visualization.

    date: "2025-06-27T10:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To evolve the Decision Tapestry from a static site generator into a dynamic, interactive web application, enabling real-time collaboration on the product backlog.
      - This requires a fundamental architectural shift to a client-server model, which will be implemented incrementally to mitigate risk.
    tradeoffs:
      - Increases architectural complexity significantly, introducing a persistent server and API layer.
      - The benefits of a fully interactive, self-contained workflow justify the increase in complexity.

    title: Implement Real-time UI Updates via WebSockets
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-28T15:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To improve collaboration, the UI should provide real-time feedback on actions performed via the CLI.
      - A persistent WebSocket connection is more efficient than polling for updates and enables the server to push changes to the client instantly.
    tradeoffs:
      - Increases server and client complexity by introducing stateful WebSocket connections.
      - Adds a new dependency (`ws`) to the project.

    title: Deprecate Static Build Step for a Fully Dynamic Server
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-28T15:30:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The introduction of a dynamic server with WebSockets makes the static site generation script (generate-dashboard.mjs) redundant.
      - Removing the build step simplifies the architecture, reduces dependencies, and speeds up the development feedback loop.
    tradeoffs:
      - The server is now responsible for serving the initial HTML shell, but this is a minor concern.

    title: Implement Decision Velocity Analytics

    date: "2025-06-29T18:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To provide a quantitative measure of our project's momentum and visualize trends in our decision-making process over time.
      - To keep the UI clean and avoid major layout changes, the analytics will be displayed in a new tab within the left-hand panel.

    title: Enhance Decision Velocity Analytics with Charting and Time Controls
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-29T19:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - A bar chart provides a more intuitive visualization of decision velocity than a plain list.
      - Allowing for different time groupings (days, weeks, months) provides more powerful and flexible analysis.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a new dependency (Chart.js) for charting, increasing the client-side footprint.
      - Increases the complexity of the analytics rendering logic.

    title: Implement Project Health Metrics
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes

    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To provide at-a-glance insights into the health and stability of our decision-making process.
      - The metrics will be displayed in the existing Analytics tab to maintain UI consistency and avoid layout changes.
    tradeoffs:
      - Starting with a simple text display for the metrics to avoid premature complexity in visualization.

    title: Enhance Health Metrics with a Pie Chart Visualization
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - A pie chart provides a more direct and intuitive visualization of the proportion of Accepted vs. Superseded decisions than raw numbers.
    tradeoffs:
      - Replaces the simple text display with a chart, which may take up more vertical space.

    rationale:
      - To provide immediate, in-context visibility into why a piece of code was changed by linking it directly to the decision that prompted it.
      - This is a core feature of the "Enhanced Developer Experience" phase, bridging the gap between the code and the narrative behind it.
    tradeoffs:
      - Can add minor visual clutter to the editor gutter.
      - The initial implementation will rely on exact path matching in `affected_components`, which may need to be refined later for more complex scenarios.

    title: "Refactor: Implement Debounced File Watching for Real-time UI Updates"
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-25T16:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The existing real-time update mechanism, which relies on `fs.watchFile`, has proven to be unreliable. A more robust solution is needed to ensure the UI is always in sync with the data.
      - Using `fs.watch` with a debounce mechanism provides a more resilient and efficient system that is not prone to multiple-trigger errors from file saves.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a small amount of complexity (the debounce logic) to the server.

    rationale:
      - The current CodeLens is not context-aware; it just opens the dashboard. A more useful implementation would show the specific, relevant decisions and allow the user to focus on one.
      - This improves the user workflow by taking them directly to the information they need, fulfilling the core goal of the Code-to-Decision linking feature.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a small amount of complexity to the extension's command handling logic.

    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To create a more cohesive and intuitive user experience by deeply linking the interactive components of the dashboard.
      - When a user interacts with one part of the UI (like the search bar or decision log), other parts of the UI (like the map) should react intelligently.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds more event listeners and client-side logic to the application, slightly increasing complexity.

    title: "Fix: Make File Watcher Resilient to Rename Events"
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-25T20:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The file watcher was only listening for 'change' events, causing it to fail when editors use a "save-and-rename" strategy, which fires a 'rename' event.
      - This fix makes the real-time update mechanism more resilient by handling both event types, ensuring reliability across different platforms and editors.
    tradeoffs:
      - None. This is a direct bug fix.

    title: "Implement: Dockerize the Decision Tapestry Application"
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-26T10:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - To fulfill the "Universal Portability" goal of the project by packaging the application into a self-contained Docker image.
      - This will allow any developer to run the tool without needing a local Node.js installation, making it accessible to a much wider audience.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a new artifact (`Dockerfile`) to maintain.
      - Users will need to have Docker installed on their system to use this distribution method.

    title: "Fix: Correct fs Module Import for Synchronous Methods"
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-06-26T12:00:00.000Z"
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The server was crashing with a TypeError because `fs.existsSync` was being called on the `fs/promises` module, which does not contain synchronous methods.
      - This fix corrects the module imports to use both the core `fs` module for synchronous calls and the `fs/promises` module for async operations, resolving the startup crash.
    tradeoffs:
      - Introduces a second `fs` import, which is a minor code complexity but necessary for correctness.

  - title: "Implement: Future Architecture: Granular Data Binding"
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - The frontend architecture has been successfully refactored to use Lit components for all major UI areas, including the decision map, log, analytics, and health metrics.
      - This migration has resulted in significantly improved performance, maintainability, and user experience.
      - The new architecture enables robust, granular updates to only the components that have changed, eliminating unnecessary re-renders and UI glitches.
      - The codebase is now more modular, testable, and easier to extend for future features.
    tradeoffs:
      - Minimal DOM Diffing (Vanilla JS): Can be complex to implement correctly. Prone to bugs and difficult to maintain as the UI grows.
      - Lightweight Frontend Library (e.g., Preact, Lit): Required a one-time effort to refactor the rendering logic into components and integrate the new library, but the benefits have proven substantial.
      - Full Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Vue): Not pursued, as Lit provided the right balance of power and simplicity for our needs.

    title: Refactor to Flat Repo Structure and Remove VS Code Extension

      commit_count: 76
      git_derived: true
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Simplifies the codebase by removing unnecessary monorepo complexity.
      - Reduces maintenance overhead and onboarding friction for new contributors.
      - Focuses development on the core Decision Tapestry app, improving velocity and clarity.
      - Removes the VS Code extension to streamline the project and avoid confusion until it is ready for dedicated support.
    tradeoffs:
      - Loses the ability to develop and release the VS Code extension in parallel for now.
      - Requires migration of all app code and configuration to the root directory.
      - Some documentation and workflow updates required to match the new structure.

    title: Provide a Template decisions.yml for New Projects
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    created: "2025-07-01T00:00:00Z"
    status: Done
    rationale:
      - Ensure that new users and AI agents have a clear, canonical starting point for structuring decision logs and backlogs.
      - Promote consistency and best practices across all projects using Decision Tapestry.
      - Make onboarding and automation easier by providing a ready-to-use template.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a small maintenance burden to keep the template up to date with evolving schema and best practices.
    tasks:
      - description: Draft a template decisions.yml file that matches the current best practices and schema.
        status: Done
      - description: Add the template to the package (e.g., as decisions.template.yml or in docs/).
        status: Done
      - description: Reference the template in the README and CLI help output.
        status: Done
      - description: Ensure the template is updated whenever the schema or conventions change.
        status: Pending
      - description: Add allowed status values as comments in the template for tasks, backlog items, and decisions.
        status: Done
      - description: Create a machine-readable JSON schema for decisions.yml (decisions.schema.json).
        status: Done
    notes: |
      The template is now available as decisions.template.yml and referenced in onboarding prompts and documentation. All new projects can start from this canonical schema example.

    title: Use Contextual Onboarding CLI to Generate Cursor Planning Prompt
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes

      commit_count: 35
      git_derived: true
    status: Done
    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Ensures onboarding is tailored to the user's actual project context.
      - Leverages the power of AI chat (Cursor) for flexible, collaborative planning.
      - Reduces friction and cognitive load for new users.
      - Makes Decision Tapestry more adaptable across diverse project types.
    tradeoffs:
      - Relies on users being comfortable with copy-pasting prompts into Cursor or another AI chat.
      - Less "hands-on" than a fully interactive CLI wizard.
    tasks:
      - description: Implement CLI command to inspect project and generate onboarding prompt.
        status: Done
      - description: Output prompt to console and (optionally) to a file.
        status: Done
      - description: Update documentation to reflect new onboarding flow.
        status: Done
      - description: Reference the canonical schema and allowed status values in the onboarding prompt.
        status: Done
      - description: Add schema validation to the CLI (validate command).

      - decisions.template.yml
    notes: |
      The CLI 'plan' command now generates a context-aware onboarding prompt for Cursor chat, including a live schema example from @decisions.template.yml. The onboarding experience also features a modern ASCII art banner in the 'init' command, and schema validation is available via the CLI.

    project: Decision Tapestry
    rationale:
      - Restore the intuitive UX where clicking a decision on the map scrolls the log to the corresponding item.
      - This feature was present before the migration and is important for usability and navigation.
    tradeoffs:
      - Adds a small amount of code to the decision-log-panel component.

      - Ensure tests, linting, and backlog/decision sync are always up-to-date without manual intervention.
      - Reduce human error and accelerate feedback cycles.
    tradeoffs:
      - Requires initial setup and monitoring of background agents.
      - May introduce complexity in debugging automated actions.

    notes: |
      This decision resolves four critical UX issues identified through real user feedback: 1. Manual decision updates → capture command for instant logging 2. Unclear onboarding → smart init with project-aware guidance   3. Complex README → 85% reduction with quick-start focus 4. No historical context → analyze command for existing projects The result is a seamless development workflow where decision tracking becomes natural rather than burdensome.

    notes: |
      This decision represents a meta-approach to development where we build real-time activity  tracking using coordinated AI agents, with the development process itself becoming a live  demonstration of the capability. The decision graph will show agent coordination, dependencies,  and feature completion in real-time as the system builds itself.
      COMPLETION STATUS (2025-07-13): ✅ Agent-1 (Infrastructure): WebSocket protocol, activity APIs, persistence - COMPLETE ✅ Agent-2 (Frontend): Visual indicators, dashboard components, animations - COMPLETE   ✅ Agent-3 (Integration): Claude Code hooks, activity detection, CLI - COMPLETE ✅ Agent-4 (Testing): End-to-end validation, performance testing - COMPLETE 🔄 Agent-5 (Documentation): Started with CLAUDE.md, coordination patterns pending
      The system successfully demonstrates real-time AI agent coordination with visual feedback in the decision graph. All core functionality is working and production-ready.

    title: Implement context-aware resilient agent framework with three-layer enrichment
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-07-16T16:30:00Z"
    status: Completed
    rationale:
      - Agents need sufficient context to make informed decisions
      - Context should come from multiple sources for completeness
      - Quality validation ensures agents have minimum required information
      - Resilient framework provides production-ready reliability
      - Backward compatibility allows gradual migration
    tradeoffs:
      - Increased complexity with three-layer context model
      - Additional latency from context enrichment
      - Memory overhead for context caching
      - Requires configuration of quality thresholds

    title: Implement robust agent lifecycle management with UI error handling and comprehensive testing
    author: Claude & Chris Barnes
    date: "2025-07-16T18:40:00Z"
    status: Completed
    rationale:
      - Agent cleanup failures leave stuck states in the dashboard
      - UI visualization errors crash the decision map during agent activities
      - Need comprehensive testing to validate entire agent lifecycle
      - Production systems require reliable state management
      - Real-time visualization must handle rapid message updates
    tradeoffs:
      - Additional complexity in shutdown procedures
      - More defensive coding increases codebase size
      - Throttling may delay some real-time updates
      - Test suite adds maintenance overhead
