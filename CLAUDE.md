# Decision Tapestry - Claude Code Integration Guide

## Overview

Decision Tapestry now includes real-time activity tracking that shows what you're currently working on in the decision graph. This creates a live development experience where you can watch your progress unfold visually.

## Quick Start for Development Sessions

### 1. Start the Dashboard

```bash
npm start
# Opens at http://localhost:8080
```

### 2. Enable Activity Tracking (Optional)

```bash
# Start activity tracking for this coding session
decision-tapestry activity start "Working on feature X"

# Or use the integrated Claude Code monitoring
node claude-code-integration/monitor.mjs
```

### 3. Code with Visual Feedback

As you work with Claude Code, your activities will automatically appear in the dashboard:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Working (editing files, building features)
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Debugging (fixing errors, troubleshooting)
- ðŸ”µ **Blue**: Testing (running tests, validation)
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple**: Reviewing (code review, documentation)

## What You'll See in Real-Time

### Decision Map Indicators

- **Colored borders** on decision nodes showing current activity
- **Background highlighting** (50% opacity of the border color)
- **Agent badges** showing which agent is working on what
- **Activity labels** with current task descriptions

### Activity Panels

- **Agent Status Panel**: Live view of all active agents
- **Activity Timeline**: Chronological history of development activities
- **Analytics**: Activity patterns and productivity metrics

## Commands for Manual Activity Tracking

```bash
# Basic activity commands
decision-tapestry activity start "Feature development"
decision-tapestry activity end
decision-tapestry activity status

# Context-aware activities (auto-maps to decisions)
decision-tapestry activity context "Implementing authentication"
decision-tapestry activity toggle  # Enable/disable tracking
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### For Individual Development

1. Start Decision Tapestry dashboard
2. Begin coding - activities auto-detected through file changes
3. Watch your progress visualized in real-time
4. Use activity history to track productivity patterns

### For Team Collaboration

1. Each developer can broadcast their activities
2. See team coordination in the decision graph
3. Identify dependencies and blockers visually
4. Track multi-person feature development

### For AI-Assisted Development

- Claude Code activities are automatically tracked
- Tool usage maps to activity states (Edit=working, Bash=testing, etc.)
- File changes are linked to relevant decisions
- Multi-agent coordination shows distributed AI development

## Technical Details

### Activity API

```javascript
// POST /api/activity
{
  "agentId": "your-name",
  "state": "working|debugging|testing|reviewing|idle",
  "decisionId": 123,
  "taskDescription": "What you're doing"
}

// GET /api/activity?includeHistory=true
// GET /api/activity/analytics?timeRange=1h
```

### File-to-Decision Mapping

The system automatically maps file changes to decisions using `affected_components`:

```yaml
# In decisions.yml
- id: 42
  title: "Add Authentication"
  affected_components:
    - src/auth/
    - server/middleware/auth.js
```

### WebSocket Real-Time Updates

All activity changes broadcast via WebSocket for immediate dashboard updates.

## Best Practices

### 1. Decision-Driven Development

- Create decisions BEFORE starting major work
- Link file changes to decisions via `affected_components`
- Use descriptive task descriptions in activities

### 2. Activity State Guidelines

- **working**: Building new features, writing code
- **debugging**: Fixing bugs, troubleshooting issues
- **testing**: Running tests, validation, QA
- **reviewing**: Code review, documentation, analysis
- **idle**: Between tasks, meetings, breaks

### 3. Team Coordination

- Use consistent agent naming (your name/initials)
- Include decision IDs in activity descriptions
- End activities when switching contexts
- Review activity analytics for productivity insights

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Updating

1. Check server is running at localhost:8080
2. **Refresh browser** to load latest components and CSS changes
3. Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors
4. Verify activities are being sent: `curl localhost:8080/api/activity`
5. **CSS/styling changes require browser refresh** - only activity data updates in real-time

### Activities Not Auto-Detecting

1. Ensure Claude Code integration is enabled
2. Check file paths match `affected_components` in decisions.yml
3. Verify monitor.mjs is running if using manual integration

### Performance Issues

- Activity history is limited to 1000 entries
- Analytics queries are time-bounded
- WebSocket connections auto-reconnect
- Clear old activities: POST /api/activity with state="idle"

## Future Enhancements

This system provides the foundation for:

- Productivity analytics and reporting
- Team coordination visualization
- Automated progress tracking
- Integration with other development tools
- Multi-project activity aggregation

The meta-experience demonstrates how AI agents can coordinate development work while visualizing their own coordination process in real-time.

## UI Component Naming Conventions

- The filtering component is called "Filters" (not "Advanced Filters")
- When the user says "we shall" this indicates a permanent rule change that should be remembered

## AI Canvas Visual Communication Rules

### Automatic Visual Generation
When responding, ALWAYS check if visual communication would enhance understanding. Use the AI Canvas automatically for:

1. **Code Explanations** (trigger: explain/how does/implement)
   - Show syntax-highlighted code with inline annotations
   - Visualize execution flow for complex logic
   - Display before/after code transformations

2. **Architecture Discussions** (trigger: architecture/system/design)
   - Generate system diagrams showing components and relationships
   - Create interactive architecture maps
   - Show service dependencies and data flow

3. **Comparisons** (trigger: compare/difference/vs/alternative)
   - Side-by-side visualizations of options
   - Pros/cons matrices
   - Visual diffs for code or configurations

4. **Multi-step Processes** (trigger: step/process/workflow)
   - Flowcharts with decision points
   - Progress trackers for ongoing tasks
   - Sequential diagrams for complex procedures

5. **UI/UX Discussions** (trigger: ui/interface/wireframe/layout)
   - Instant wireframe generation
   - Interactive mockups
   - Component layout demonstrations

6. **Data Structures** (trigger: data/schema/model/structure)
   - Visual JSON/object representations
   - Database schema diagrams
   - Entity relationship visualizations

7. **Debugging Sessions** (trigger: error/bug/issue/debug)
   - Error flow diagrams
   - Stack trace visualizations
   - Debugging step sequences

8. **Progress Updates** (trigger: progress/status/todo/complete)
   - Live progress bars
   - Task completion trackers
   - Milestone visualizations

### Visual Generation Guidelines
- **Automatic Triggering**: Generate visuals WITHOUT being asked when patterns match
- **Seamless Integration**: Display visuals alongside text responses
- **Context Awareness**: Choose appropriate visual types based on discussion
- **Non-Intrusive**: Visuals enhance but don't interrupt conversation flow
- **Smart Timing**: Wait 30+ seconds between visuals to avoid spam

### Canvas Integration
```javascript
// Always available in responses:
import { visualCoordinator } from './claude-code-integration/ai-visual-coordinator.mjs';
import canvas from './claude-code-integration/ai-canvas-helper.mjs';

// Analyze every response for visual opportunities
const enhanced = await visualCoordinator.processResponse(myResponse);
```

### Visual Priority Rules
- **High Priority**: Architecture, code explanations, UI mockups, debugging
- **Medium Priority**: Comparisons, data structures, progress updates
- **Low Priority**: Simple lists, basic descriptions, confirmations

Remember: The AI Canvas is YOUR visual voice. Use it proactively to communicate complex ideas clearly and efficiently.

## AI Canvas Frequency Modes

You can control how often I use the AI Canvas for visual communication:

```bash
# Set to moderate mode (default) - visuals for complex concepts
decision-tapestry canvas-mode moderate

# Set to UNHINGED mode - MAXIMUM VISUAL CHAOS! 
decision-tapestry canvas-mode unhinged
```

**Moderate Mode** (default):
- Architecture diagrams when explaining system design
- Flowcharts for complex workflows
- Code comparisons for significant changes
- Progress tracking for multi-step implementations
- Only when it adds clear value to the explanation

**UNHINGED Mode** ðŸš€:
- Diagrams for EVERYTHING
- Progress bars for basic tasks
- Visualizations of thought processes
- Random architecture drawings
- Celebration graphics for success
- Visual representations of errors
- Basically, if I can draw it, I WILL draw it

The setting is stored in `settings/ai-canvas-settings.json` and persists across sessions.

### Time Budget

To prevent spending too long on visuals (especially in UNHINGED mode), there's a time budget:

```json
"timeBudget": {
  "enabled": true,
  "seconds": 10,     // Maximum time to create a visual
  "warningAt": 7     // Warning threshold
}
```

This keeps visual creation snappy and prevents analysis paralysis!
