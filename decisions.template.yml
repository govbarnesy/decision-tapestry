# Template and Examples for Decision Tapestry
#
# This file shows both minimal and comprehensive examples of decision and backlog items.
# Only 'id', 'title', and 'status' are required. All other fields are optional.
#
# IMPORTANT: The top-level structure should be:
# - decisions: []  (array of decision objects)
# - backlog: []    (array of backlog objects - optional)
#
# NOT nested like: decisions: { backlog: [], decided: [] }

# ============================================================================
# MINIMAL EXAMPLE - Only required fields
