# Multi-Agent Development Coordination Status

## Project: Real-Time Development Activity Tracking

**Meta-Goal**: Build real-time activity visualization while demonstrating distributed AI development coordination through the Decision Tapestry dashboard itself.

## Agent Roster & Responsibilities

- **Role**: Backend WebSocket protocol, activity APIs, persistence layer
- **Current Task**: Not started
- **Dependencies**: Coordination protocol from Agent-0
- **Deliverables**: 
  - Extended WebSocket protocol with activity messages
  - `/api/activity` endpoints for state management
  - Activity persistence and state tracking
  - Real-time broadcast infrastructure

### 🎨 Frontend Agent (Agent-2)

- **Role**: Visual indicators, animations, dashboard enhancements
- **Current Task**: Not started
- **Dependencies**: Activity data schema from Agent-1
- **Deliverables**:
  - Activity visualization components (pulsing, badges, colors)
  - Decision map real-time updates
  - Agent coordination visualization
  - Animation and transition systems

### 🔌 Integration Agent (Agent-3)
- **Status**: Waiting for assignment

- **Dependencies**: Activity API from Agent-1
- **Deliverables**:
  - Claude Code tool usage monitoring
  - Activity pattern recognition (working, debugging, testing)
  - Decision-to-file mapping logic
  - Auto-activity broadcasting

### 🧪 Testing Agent (Agent-4)
- **Status**: Waiting for assignment
- **Role**: Validation, integration testing, meta-system verification
- **Current Task**: Not started
- **Dependencies**: All other agents' deliverables
- **Deliverables**:
  - End-to-end activity flow testing
  - Multi-agent coordination validation
  - Performance testing for real-time updates
  - User experience verification

### 📖 Meta-Documentation Agent (Agent-5)
- **Status**: Waiting for assignment
- **Role**: Document the coordination process itself as a reusable pattern
- **Current Task**: Not started

- **Deliverables**:
  - Multi-agent development methodology documentation
  - Coordination pattern templates
  - Lessons learned and best practices
  - Decision templates for future distributed work

## Coordination Protocol

### 🔄 Status Update Cycle
1. **Every 15 minutes**: Agents update their status in this document
2. **Real-time**: Agents broadcast activity to Decision Tapestry as they work
3. **On completion**: Agents update decision tasks and notify dependencies
4. **On blockers**: Agents flag issues and request coordination

### 📊 Progress Visualization
- **Agent nodes** in decision graph showing current activity
- **Dependency edges** between agent work items  
- **Real-time status** updates in dashboard
- **Completion flow** through the decision tree

### 🚧 Dependency Management
```
Agent-0 (Coordinator) → Agent-1 (Infrastructure) → Agent-2 (Frontend)
                     → Agent-3 (Integration)    → Agent-4 (Testing)
                     → Agent-5 (Documentation)
```

### 📝 Communication Channels
- **decisions.yml**: Formal decisions and task completion
- **This document**: Real-time status and coordination
- **Decision Tapestry dashboard**: Live activity visualization
- **Git commits**: Work product delivery and integration points

## Current Phase: Coordination Infrastructure Complete ✅

**Completed Actions**:
1. ✅ Master Coordinator created coordination infrastructure
2. ✅ Defined agent work packages in decisions.yml (Decisions #55-60)
3. ✅ Set up status tracking and dependency management system
4. ✅ Created meta-visualization foundation

**Next Actions**:
1. ⏳ Begin Agent-1 (Infrastructure) work on WebSocket extensions
2. ⏳ Start Agent-2 (Frontend) parallel work on visual design
3. ⏳ Initialize real-time activity broadcasting to demonstrate coordination
4. ⏳ Begin meta-experience: show agents working in decision graph

**Blockers**: None currently identified

**Dependency Map**:
```
Decision #55 (Coordination) → Ready for agent assignment
Decision #56 (Infrastructure) → Ready to start (no dependencies)
Decision #57 (Frontend) → Depends on #56 activity API schema
Decision #58 (Integration) → Depends on #56 activity endpoints  
Decision #59 (Testing) → Depends on #56, #57, #58 completion
Decision #60 (Documentation) → Depends on coordination patterns from all agents
```

**Meta-Experience Status**: 
- 🎯 **Goal**: By the end, watch agents coordinate in real-time through the decision graph
- 📊 **Current**: Static decisions visible, ready for dynamic activity overlay
- 🔄 **Next**: Agent activity will appear as visual updates in dashboard

**Estimated Timeline**: 
- ✅ Setup: Complete
- Parallel development: 3-5 days  
- Integration: 2-3 days
- Testing & polish: 1-2 days
- **Meta-demonstration**: Throughout development process

## Ready for Agent Assignment 🚀

The coordination infrastructure is now complete. Agents can be assigned to their respective decisions and begin parallel work. The meta-experience begins now - each agent's work will be tracked and visualized in the Decision Tapestry dashboard as they build the real-time activity system itself.
